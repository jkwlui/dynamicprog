Small cases:
"This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.
This little piggy had roast beef.
This little piggy had none.
And this little piggy cried wee wee wee all the way home."

Substantial case:
"Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely,
having little or no money in my purse,
and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world."

2. Mathematical recurrence for cost of sum of
squared slacks in optimal solution:
b = line break

Cost = (n-1) Î£ (i=1) [sum(bi, bi+1 - 1)^2]

3. Memoized version should be in linear time

4. Java

5. L = max(line.length);

FindMinSlack(Text){

SquaresOfSlacksOfAllLines = []

  for every word in Text {

      LeftHandSide =
      RightHandSide =
      slack= LeftHandSide - RightHandSide
      }
    min(sum of squares of slacks of all lines)
    }
