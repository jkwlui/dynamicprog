Substantial case:
"Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely,
having little or no money in my purse,
and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world."

2. Mathematical recurrence for cost of sum of
squared slacks in optimal solution:

Define OPT(k) to be the optimum solution (minimize slack spaces for all lines) for
lines containing words w(1) up to w(k).

Define S(i,k) to be the slack space(s) of a line that contains the words w(i) up to w(k).
Define S(i,k) := infinity if such line exceeds the maximum number of words allowed for a line.

Then OPT(k) = min_(i<=i<=k) [(S^2(i,k)) + OPT(k-1)]
Define OPT(0) = 0    // optimal solution for the set of 0 words is 0. (no slack space for no words)

That is, find the minimum squared cost (slack space) by iteratively fitting more words into
a line and finding the optimal solution of the remaining words.

Therefore, the optimal solution of w(1)..w(n) is computed by finding OPT(n) - building up
from OPT(0), OPT(1), .. , OPT(n)

5. L = max(line.length);

FindMinSlack(Text){

SquaresOfSlacksOfAllLines = []

  for every word in Text {
    if sum(characters in word + 1) <= L {

      RightHandSide =
      slack= LeftHandSide - RightHandSide
      }
    min(sum of squares of slacks of all lines)
